this is factorial on c#
`public int fact(int num) {
     return (num == 0) ? 1 : num * fact(num - 1);
}`
lets try to wrap into tag some words here
`public int _fact_ (int __num__ ) {
     return ( __num__ == 0) ? 1 : __num__ * _fact_ ( __num__ - 1);
}`
nothing has happened!

`_a \`a_ a\` ` => _a `a_ a`

lets repeat that many times
===========================================

This is test _string

this must be wrapped anyway_
This __is test__ _this is test too_
next symbol __ must not be wrapped
and how about `that?

(define (factorial n)
   (if (= n 0)
       1
       (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))`

it was factorial __(scheme)__ and nothing must not be wrapped there
